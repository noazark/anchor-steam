Anchor Steam (chrome extension)
===============================

Search through the links on the page opened in your browser! I was really quite annoied with searching for links that I
knew existed on a page. I would usually search on the page (`cmd+f` or `ctrl+f`) for the link's text, but then I would
be left to click it.

Anchor Steam takes all the links on your opened page and lets you search through them in Chrome's Omnibox.

## How To Use

1. [Download and install](https://github.com/noazark/anchor-steam/releases/download/0.0.1/anchor-steam.crx)
2. Type ">" into the Omnibox and then hit the "tab" key
3. Search away!

# Development

If you're interested in helping me out developing this tool, feel free! Open a pull request and lets talk about getting
your code into the next version. If you're not sure what I just said take a look at
[GitHub Flow](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser), or create a
[new Issue](/noazark/anchor-steam/issues/new) and ask for a feature!

## P.S.

This tool is in no way related (and neither am I) to the famous brewery that produces a beer of the same name. Anchor
Steam searches through anchor tags (`<a></a>`) using a steam engine. This is the only qualified name for the tool,
sorry if there was any confusion.
